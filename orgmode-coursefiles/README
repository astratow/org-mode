Getting yourself organzied with Orgmode

Coursefiles

These are the coursfiles for all lessons. Filenames
follow the scheme

sec-x.y-{start|end|}-$filename

The files are just examples. The demo setup was
done for a a user account joe with a directory
"org".

If files change during a lessons you can spot the
difference by comparing the "start" and "end" version.

CAUTION:
The ".emacs" files are not meant to overwrite your own ".emacs"
files. You should open them in Emacs and then copy/paste what
code snippets you need to your own ".emacs" file.
